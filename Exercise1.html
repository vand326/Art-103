  <h3>"Detective Saihara", Digital Art, Clip Studio Paint & Photoshop, 2018</h3>
I drew this character from one of my favorite games, New Danganronpa V3.
I drew him in a Sherlock Holmes outfit because his role in the game is the detective.

  <h3> "Black Hamburger", Digital Art, Clip Studio Paint & Photoshop, 2018</h3>
   This is my first time drawing food portrait and I wanted to add a unique colors into the foods that
   we don't normally see. This black hamburger can be found in Japan.

  <h3> "Nintendo Memorial", Perler Beads, 2019</h3>

  I created a memorial peace for the late President of Nintendo, Satoru Iwata. This was my first time using perler beads
  as a medium. In the beginning, I wanted to paint a portrait of the president but later thought it's not something new to me.
  When I passed by my brother's room one day, I saw a pokemon figure made out of perler beads that he got from an anime convention.
  This gave me the idea to create the Nintendo consoles out of perler beads for the memorial project.
